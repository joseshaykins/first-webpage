# first-webpage
## Overview
Welcome! this is my first full webpage design, given as an assignment on [theodinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page), it has helped me become more accustomed to problem-solving. while some parts of the webpage might seem as a result of ignorance to someone with experience, everything has been done with the specific purpose of replicating the provided design images[^1].

### Suggestion for Users
Users may decide to edit some part of the documents to suit personal preference, for example the card class in the html file may contain an actual image and the empty-box divs may contain actual images.

#### Reference Images
The following images were used to provide the design reference for the webpage:

[^1]: It should also be noted that as this is my first webpage design, it was created specifically to be viewed on PC web browsers and may not look good on mobile devices.
